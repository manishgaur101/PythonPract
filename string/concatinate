# we cannot combine strings and numbers with + operator
# But we can combine strings and numbers by using f-strings or the format() method!

# fstring
age = 36
txt = f"My name is John, I am {age}" # {} here is a placeholder
print(txt)

# placeholder can contain variables, operations, functions, and modifiers to format the value.
# A modifier is included by adding a colon : followed by a legal formatting type, like .2f which means fixed point number with 2 decimals:
price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price:.2f} dollars"
print(txt)

# placeholder containing operations
txt = f"The price is {20 * 59} dollars"
print(txt)
