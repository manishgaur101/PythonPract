# If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. # This is called unpacking.

# Example - Unpack a List

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# Unpacking a Tuple

'''
Need to see this - The number of variables must match the number of values in the tuple, if not, you must use an asterisk to collect the remaining values as a list.
'''

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

(green, yellow, red) = fruits

print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)
