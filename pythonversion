''' Unlike java we need to import default modules also to avoid conflict.
Python does provide a set of built-in functions (print, len, int, etc.) that are always available without import.
These are part of Python's global namespace and are the closest equivalent to Java's default imports.

# Both sys and platform are default modules and are cross platform means will work on all OS
